# Recommended emulator versions

For the best experience, I recommend these specific versions.


## RetroArch
**Version 1.9.4**

* Older versions of RetroArch don't support launchers.
* Versions 1.11 onward fail to launch games with '&' in the filename

## ScummVM: 
**Version 2.6.1**

* I found some games don't launch on ScummVM version 2.7.0.
* 2.6.1 works for me.

## Adrenaline
**6.61 Adrenaline-7**

* The official 6.61 Adrenaline-7 by TheOfficialFloW is required if you intend to use RetroFlow for PSP and PS1 games. 
* If you are on a lower / higher version of Adrenaline or a fork of Adrenaline, please install the one in the link below.
